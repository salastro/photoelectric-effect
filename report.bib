    abstract = {There is much evidence to show that lunar “horizon glow” and “streamers” observed at the terminator are caused by sunlight scattered by dust grains originating from the surface. The dust grains and lunar surface are electrostatically charged by the Moon’s interaction with the local plasma environment and the photoemission of electrons due to solar UV and X-rays. This effect causes the like-charged surface and dust particles to repel each other, and creates a near-surface electric field. Previous models have explained micron-sized dust observed at ∼10cm above the surface, by suggesting that charged grains “levitate” in the local electric field; however this cannot account for observations of 0.1μm-scale grains at ∼100 km altitude. In order to explain the high-altitude dust observations, we propose a dynamic “fountain” model in which charged dust grains follow ballistic trajectories, subsequent to being accelerated upward through a narrow sheath region by the surface electric field. These dust grains could affect the optical quality of the lunar environment for astronomical observations and interfere with exploration activities.}

    abstract="Surveyor-7 photographed a bright glow along the western lunar horizon one hour after local sunset. This horizon-glow (HG) must result from the forward scattering of sunlight by electrically charged dust grains [a (grain radius) = 5 {\texttimes} 10−4 cm] which are electrostatically levitated 3 to 30 cm above rocks or surface irregularities located in the lunar terminator zone. The levitation condition is E(V cm−1) ≥ 270 {\texttimes} [a({\textmu})]1/2.Column densities the order of 50 grains cm−2 are produced. The electrostatic field is generated in the following manner. High energy (500--1500 eV) photoelectrons are ejected from directly illuminated surfaces in the terminator zone. A positive monopole charge is produced which forces the return of subsequently ejected photoelectrons to the vicinity of the illuminated surface. Computer modeling indicates that 1{\%} to 5{\%} of the returned flux will accrete on adjacent completely dark areas. A stable, multipole charge distribution is generated between the light and dark areas. The associated intense multipole electric field (E ≳ 103 V cm−1) can levitate micron size soil grains located in the charged regions. Approximately 10−2 gr cm−2 yr−1 of surface material are `churned' by this process. The photoelectron work function of the lunar material, flux level of solar X-rays ($\lambda$ {\textasciitilde} 25 {\AA}), and the attenuation of solar ultraviolet photons by multiple scattering (as controlled by local surface geometry and reflectivity) are the physically significant factors.",
